The other great part of these bands is that they are great for the p90x program. I tried out some bands and they seemed fairly week and i was kind of hesitant to getting bands because i was so use to just using weights. When i got the bands i could tell that they were a lot stronger than the other ones i used.

Back then it was a $50 pass. But you had to pay extra for a sticker that would additionally let you into other Federal locations like Conservation Areas, National Forests, etc. Now it's one convenient, multi-agency card with no additional stickers to buy.OK, so your idea of the Federal parks is the Grand Canyon and nothing else? This card might be overkill as entry to Grand Canyon is $20 per car. But, if you want to pay extra to avoid long lines you may still want to buy the pass. Passholders enter via their own lane which is very fast since there's no counting money, making change, printing receipts, etc. And remember, that the normal entry fee is just for the day. Multiple days => multiple fees => multiple times in long lines. Last time I went to the Grand Canyon I would venture to say I saved up to an hour by speeding past the money lanes.Buying this card is also very good for the parks. They are constantly underfunded and have been for the last several years since their budgets have been slashed. The funds paid for this card go directly to the Park Service, Forest Service, etc. And that money is very important as it helps pay for park facilities, maintenance, trails, visitors centers, clean bathrooms, ranger tours, etc.Oh, and at $80 for your entire family for a year, this is a steal compared to theme parks.

On the other hand, many of these exercises are overlooked in this day and age, which is a shame, because they are excellent conditioning workouts.If you are not a martial artist, don't let the title of this book deter you from buying it.

Since this 2012 edition pre-dates the latest championship, this edition obviously lacks anything having to do with the 2013 title.One of the hardest things to tell about this before buying it is just what's included. Of the 13 pages pictured on the product's cover (the ones included with this listing), 10 are in the 1975 to 2011 era (just 29 of the 64 pages, 63 pages if you discount the cover). The others (two on Ted Williams plus one from the 1915 Series) don't give a good representation of the majority of the content (the other 35 pages).Arguably, one of the most fun aspects of this is hunting for why some of the earlier pages were included. This treasure hunt reveals gems in Red Sox (and world) history which even a fairly decent fan like myself might not know (the diehards will probably be searching for the articles by date!). If you want to know what you are getting, keep reading. If you want to discover these gems for yourself, then stop reading - \\\"spoilers\\\" follow....The entire \\\"paper\\\" is split into four sections. The first (20 pages) covers 1904-1920 including a box score mention of Cy Young's perfect game, the first in baseball's \\\"modern era\\\" (according to Wikipedia), the first game played at Fenway Park, the 1912 pennant, Snodgrass's muff (which won the Sox the 7-game 1912 Series...in 8 games), and the 1915, 1916, and 1918 championships. Part of what is so wonderful about the articles from this time period is that the Sox's opponents for many of these key games were against New York-based rivals (Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers). Consequently, these articles were big local news, not just big sports news, and are sandwiched on the Times front page between such monumental world headlines as \\\"War Declared; Battle Raging in the Balkans\\\" and \\\"(Col. Theodore) Roosevelt Gains, Bullet Located, Lodged in Rib.\\\" Part 1, naturally, ends with the 1920 headline, \\\"Ruth bought by New York Americans for $125,000.\\\"Part 2 (another 20 pages) covers the relatively quiet years from 1939 to 1975, very heavily loaded with Ted Williams highlights (\\\"first big leaguer to bat in 100 runs,\\\" his All-Star game-winning HR, his 0.4057 batting average, and the change in his draft status from 1A to 3A, the homer that won the 1946 AL pennant, an AL MVP mention, another batting title, his 500th homer, and his final at-bat). It also includes mentions of Jimmy Foxx's 500th career homer and Lefty Grove's 300th victory.Part 2 continues with a 1967 piece on Bill Rohr's rookie debut game - a one-hitter. This page also includes this amusing description of batting gloves: \\\"When Yankee Stadium opened in 1923....players and spectators then would have been flabbergasted at the idea of batters wearing golf gloves, and Ruth's comments might have been unprintable. Today, it is commonplace equipment, and several players on each team wear them to reduce blisters and other shocks\\\" which nicely captures the changes in the times (from 1923 to 1967 to present where pretty much everyone wears them) and the Babe's infamously colorful personality in one fell swoop.This is followed by coverage of the 1967 pennant, Yaz's signing, Jim Lonborg's Cy Young victory, and the 1975 pennant.  Part 2 ends and Part 3 (16 pages) begins on a high note, with the Sox tied in Game 6 of the 1975 Series. Part 3 mercifully skips the next few weeks and fast-forwards to Fred Lynn's record setting MVP (first AL rookie to be named MVP). The other highlights in the following grim years for the Sox include Yaz's 3000th hit and retirement, the Rocket's 20-K game, the '86 pennant, and (painfully, for those of us who remember this Series well), coverage of Game 7 vs the Mets. :/ Ugh. `Nuff said.This section continues with coverage of the 1990 Division title, Roger Clemens's third Cy Young, Pedro's 1999 All-Star classic (which includes a photo of Ted Williams, who threw out the first pitch, and includes historically interesting coverage of Pete Rose's presence on the All-Century ballot, and of day one of Lance Armstrong's first Tour de France defense...also noteworth: the caption on Pedro's pic notes that \\\"his victims included Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire.\\\" Part 3 thematically ends with Ted Williams' obituary and several long retrospectives on his career and impact, and with the 2003 Division series title (featuring the massive outfield Collision between Johnny Damon and Damian Jackson).The last few pages of Part 3 begin the chronicle of the 2004 journey (stuck in this section, presumably, because the pages need to be grouped in 4s). The story begins with Game 6 of the ALCS  featuring the famed A-Rod pansy slap at Bronson Arroyo, and Curt Schilling's famed bloody sock. The first page of Part 4 (8 pages) features Tek jumping into Alan Embree's arms after the victory over the Yankees and includes another page including articles on the \\\"Yankee mercenaries\\\" and the \\\"Monumental Collapse.\\\" Mark Bellhorn's clanger of Pesky's Pole in the 2004 Series gets a mention and then it skips ahead to the good part where Sox fans can \\\"Kiss That Curse Goodbye: After 86 Years, Boston Gives the Boot To the Bambino.\\\"The 2007 coverage includes just Schilling's Game 1 victory in the World Seriews, and the subsequent \\\"Coronation.\\\" The final pages include (oddly) Johnny Damon (as a Yankee)'s first visit to the DL (after over 10 years in the Majors), Wakefield's 2009 All-Star debut after 17 seasons, and last, in what must have seemed like a good idea at the time, an article on Bobby Valentine.I hope if the NYT updates this to include the 2013 title that they'll pitch the coverage of the 1986 Series finale and remove the article on Valentine (really - if they're going to include a manager article, it should be on Terry Francona, not Valentine or John Farrell) and should, in my opinion, include (much) more on the epic 2004 Yankees/Sox series. Some key highlights that I would want to see include the Idiots and their Why Not Us shirts, Dave Roberts's steal, Papi's Game 4 and 5 walk-offs, or even the Wakefield's heroics in the Game fiasco of a loss or the massive Duck parade that followed. Sure, the subsequent titles were/are great (yeah, call me spoiled), but the 2004 Championship will always be the one that broke the curse - and for that reason, to me, warrants more coverage.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"I received this as ...\"}, \"This is a great Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga video.It can be used to practice  with or in watch and learn mode.Richard gives good instruction to the poses  and a good introduction to the basics like Ujayi breath and Drishti  (gaze).The flow from posture to posture (Vinyasa) is also breathtaking  (especially appreciated by those who have stumbled through it  themselves).Richard Freeman is an excellent practitioner and teacher, and  while no video can substitute for a good teacher, this is still as good as  it gets for Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga.It might prove daunting for beginners and  the uninitiated.The best use of this video would be to reinforce what you  learned from your workshops or your regular teacher.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This is a great ...\"}, \"Not enough reviews.

But I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote something along the lines of, \\\"So what if they wore out and broke, it means you're using them! Buy another set and wear those out too!\\\" I love that review.These bands are so portable and easy to store, there is just no excuse to not do a workout. On nice days I've been using them outside in the fresh air, on the colder rainy days we've had lately I just use them indoors. So easy.I'm finding you can replicate almost all of the primary freeweight exercises, and several of the gym equipment exercises. There are a couple books out there that have good photos and sample circuit workouts. I bought one called \\\"Resistance Band Workout\\\", by James Milligan. It has some great photos and explanations, and tells you exactly which muscle group you are working with each exercise. I have also found some great instructional videos on BodyBuilding.com. Have a look at several references, and develop your own workout. I combine mine with lunges, squats, and cardio so I get about an hour and a half of a great workout that leaves me \\\"just right\\\" sore for the next day or two.While the bands will never take the place of \\\"real\\\" weights in my opinion, they are a superb alternative.My bands arrived in two days, but that's because I have the Amazon Prime two-day shipping thing.I really hope this helps you to decide whether or not to try these out, and if you do, please check out the above references, because they really helped me. After a fairly long haitus from \\\"organized\\\" workouts, I am getting back into it, feeling fantastic, and I find the bands are just so accessible that workouts are really easy to keep up on.And best of all: no more, oh I Have to drive to the gym, but first I Have to fix my hair and put on a fancy matching workout suit and fix up a sporty \\\"natural healthy girl\\\" makeup style so I look really cute while I'm in there... you can do these anywhere at home, wearing whatever you are comfy in, and sweat as hard as you want without wondering if your mascara is running.

I didn't put gears all over the finished coaster, as they wouldn't move. I added a vertical large gear, using a 9, on the bottom. This spins with the help of a medium horizontal gear, which is next to the extra gear coming off the auger assembly. I also added a large gear to mesh with the water wheel using a 10. To that, I added a medium gear using an 11. I put a piece of scotch tape over the sound holes on the Chamber of Sound to make it bearable.

I found that by following Sklansky's Small Stakes Hold'em I was playing far too conservatively to win.  The blinds were eating me up and I rarely got any good cards to enter pots with.  The opinions of Cloutier and McEvoy are far more practiceable I believe.What we have here is a weed's eye view of what one should do when playing pot limit and no limit hold'em.  There is some overlap with the other book but both are valuable on their own.  The authors conclude that pot limit requires more skill than limit but that no limit requires the most skill of all.While I was in Vegas, outside of the Rio where the World Series of Poker was being held, I did not see any mention of pot limit games but I've been in them a couple times online and have to state that it's one a most exciting variety of poker.  It can get crazy fast and the book is quite insightful in describing the way in which one should specifically play.The reader is given crystal clear advice on what to do in particular situations and the two authors seem to cover every single contingency that should arise.

When I finally put down Journey to Excellence, that was my thought and my feeling--a masterpiece.  Serving as a consultant to both Golf Digest and GOLF Magazine, and numerous national golf federations around the world, I've read my share of golf books--and then some.  But I've never read a golf book like Journey to Excellence.  It is, without question, a unique, fresh and powerful contribution to the golf literature.  The accomplished author, Coach Henry Brunton, uses an engaging, interactive writing style to place in these pages the wisdom of his experience, the collective wisdom of successful players and coaches, and extensive research.  The result is a highly useable guide from start to finish on how to be a successful golfer.  While the target audience is junior golfers, this volume is serviceable reading for golfers at any level, and should be required reading for parents of aspiring golfers.  Moving beyond the traditional topics of swing technique and mental game tips, Brunton offers sound research on one's chance at reaching the top rung on golf's food chain (chap. 2), excellent suggestions on `perfect practice' (chp. 5), and preparation strategies to maximize competitive performance (chp. 8).  Journey to Excellence needs to be in the library of every serious golfer, and is must reading for every parent and player in junior golf.

He knows a lot about golf in general and in particular what life is like for young people with aspirations to become collegiate golfers and touring pros.For those young golfers who have fallen in love with game, who dream of being the next Tiger or Annika (and for the parents and coaches who will help them achieve their goals), \\\"Journey to Excellence\\\" is a delightfully supportive but also down-to-earth, realistic guide to becoming the best golfers they can be. Sorry kids, you don't get to skip your homework because you need to practice.\\\"In reality, if you let your homework pile up, not only will your school work suffer, but your golf will too, as the stress of poor grades will likely leak into your golf game. Instead, it's much wiser to take the steps necessary to balance the demands of golf and the other realities of your life so that both spheres benefit,\\\" Brunton writes.But Brunton is clear that the journey begins with the fun of playing golf. \\\"For some reason, some people--a lot of people-- have fun trying to move that white ball. There are a lot of things about it that make it fun: the company is almost always good--no one is introduced to golf by people they don't like...\\\" Brunton writes on Page 1. By Page 3, fun and a passion for the game meet up with the hard work and diligence that is needed if a young golfer is to have any chance of becoming one of the 5,500 golfers playing at the NCAA Division 1 level, not to mention join the less than 500 men and women currently playing on the PGA and LPGA tours combined.There are no instructional sections here, no swing tip sequences nor references to any mechanical devices that can straighten a hook or slice. There is a chapter on how to get clubs that fit properly. How to find a coach, maximizing practice sessions to fit a young golfer's age, needs and personality; principles for self management including mental and physical training and nutrition needs; and developing a plan to win are all topics covered in this handbook. The final chapter delves into the pertinent facts about college golf.As I read the book, I paused many times to consider how Brunton's advice applies to my own desires to take my golf game to a higher level.

But in 1976, Sparky Anderson's star-laden Cincinnati Reds did just that, taking their second straight world crown by defeating the New York Yankees, four games to none.Led by catcher Johnny Bench, who was Series MVP, the Reds knocked off the Yanks by scores of 5-1, 4-3, 6-2, and 7-2.  And this came on the heels of Cincinnati's three-game sweep over the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS. 7 wins and 0 losses for the Reds in the '76 post-season!Cincy batted at a .333 clip for the four games of the '76 World Series; while New York could muster just a .222 team batting mark. The club ERA stats were equally one-sided in favor of the Reds -- Cincy's ERA was an excellent 2.00; the Yanks' pitchers amassed a poor 5.45 mark.28-year-old, 9-year veteran Johnny Lee Bench was on fire during the '76 Series, hitting .533 (8-for-15), with 2 home runs and 6 runs-batted-in. Bench also had 1 double, 1 triple, and 4 runs scored. He struck out just 1 time in the 4 contests.  This World Series performance helped to make up for Johnny's poor 1976 regular season (.234 / 16 HR / 74 RBI).Other top hitters in the '76 Series included George Foster (.429 batting average), Dave Concepcion (.357), Dan Driessen (.357), Joe Morgan (.333), Tony Perez (.313), and Cesar Geronimo (.308).On the losing Yankees' side, Thurman Munson was a hot hitter, batting .529, with nine hits in the four games. Future Reds' manager Lou Piniella hit .333 for the Yanks during the Series.Dan Driessen of the Reds had the distinction of becoming the very first National Leaguer to be used as a Designated Hitter in the World Series.  Starting with this '76 Series, the DH was used in alternate World Series. In later years, a more sensible system of utilizing the DH was implemented, whereby the DH is only used in the A.L. ballparks. The pitchers are now forced to bat in World Series' games hosted by National League teams.Cincinnati's Reds won 102 games during the regular season in '76 (following up their 108 victories from 1975), and won the N.L. West title by 10 games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The third-place team (Houston) finished a very distant 22 games behind the surging Reds.1976 also represented Cincinnati's 5th trip to the post-season during the first 7 years of the decade of the '70s (missing out on making the playoffs only in 1971 and 1974). The team would find winning their division much more difficult in future seasons, however. The Reds finished a distant second (to the Dodgers) in 1977, the year they acquired pitcher Tom Seaver from the Mets in mid-season. And they finished in 2nd place again in '78. In 1979, the Reds rounded out a successful decade by winning the N.L. West, but losing in 3 straight to the Pirates in the playoffs.MLB Home Video produced this VHS video, which is narrated by former big-league catcher Joe Garagiola. What with there only being the minimum of four games played during this '76 Series, the video's run time isn't very long (29 minutes). But all the pertinent info and game highlights are included in this color video program. (The picture quality isn't very much to write home about though.)One quibble regarding this video's packaging -- On all other World Series VHS videos put out by MLB Home Video, the team winning the Series is listed first on the box sleeve (both front and back). But, for some unknown reason, the 1976 Reds are listed SECOND on the packaging (e.g.: New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati Reds). Very odd, IMO. I have yet to encounter another video in the MLB World Series collection that makes this error and displays the losing team first on the box cover.** = EDIT: That is, up until the 2005 World Series DVD, which lists the losing team (Houston) before the victorious White Sox. Starting with that '05 disc, they started showing the losing team first for several years in a row. Mighty strange. ~shrug~Anyway, it's not a big deal obviously. Just a trivial oddity that I noticed.A semi-off-topic comment (a \\\"1976 Memory Flashback\\\") --- One of the main things I recall about the 1976 Reds/Yanks World Series is being able to watch Game 1 on \\\"videotape\\\" just minutes after the game concluded at Riverfront Stadium. In '76, video cassette recorders were brand-spanking-new, and it seemed quite remarkable (at the time) to be able to \\\"replay\\\" Game 1 of the World Series and see, at my leisure, how Don Gullett beat Doyle Alexander, 5-1.The video machine used to record that particular game was one of the early, bulky \\\"Betamax\\\" units. Remember those babies? They cost about $2,500 in '76 and didn't even include a built-in timer/clock! The timer, which resembled your bedroom's clock-radio, was a separate box that sat atop the Beta recorder. And it took TWO Beta tapes to record the game, because those tapes could only hold one hour of material. Can you imagine that today? Thank heavens for DVDs, huh?  :)To be quite technical, it might very well have taken even a THIRD Beta videotape to capture every pitch of Game 1 of the '76 Series, with the exact game time being 2 hours and 10 minutes. So, unless those old-time tapes had about 5 minutes of \\\"extra\\\" tape tacked on to their 1-hour spools (which is likely, similar to VHS tapes nowadays), then I guess a third tape must have been utilized to get the final ninth-inning out of Game #1. That final out in the Reds' 5-1 win, for the record, was a foul pop-up caught by third baseman Pete Rose, hit by Yanks' pinch-hitter Oscar Gamble. Pedro Borbon was on the mound and threw that last pitch of the game. Oh, btw, Gamble wore uniform number 23. Borbon wore #34. -- Now THAT'S baseball trivia at its finest! :-)For those who can recall the Cincinnati Reds' short-lived, two-year \\\"dynasty\\\", this video serves as a valuable keepsake and reminder of when the Reds sat atop the major-league baseball world.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"It hadn't been ...\"}, \"Finally a golf book that is simple and works.

I've worked in the golf publishing business for nearly 20 years and have never seen a step-by-step guide that explains how the best junior golfers continue to improve and reach their full potential until Journey to Excellence. It took someone of Henry Brunton's credentials to finally pull all the key information into one resource. Brunton is the Head Coach for the Canadian National Men's Team, he is the only Canadian ever named one of GOLF Magazine's Top 100 Teachers, he is the creator of the teaching curriculum used by the Canadian PGA and near Toronto he runs one of the finest regional junior programs in the world for competitive juniors. A program that has been emulated by instructors all over North America.Journey to Excellence details the intricacies of every major issue that a young competitive golfer will face while trying to become the best they can be. From equipment issues, to finding the right coach, to managing emotions to understanding how to earn a college scholarship, it's all right here in a breezy read filled with anecdotes from the game's best players who have already reached their full potential in the game.Brunton saw the need for providing honest, accurate information to the next generation of competitive golfers and spent two years working on this manuscript. It was a labor of love and it shows in the final work. I've been fortunate to know Henry for nearly 15 years and he is a major force who will lead junior golf in a positive direction for years to come.

Ashtanga is a difficult, style of yoga. If you are not familiar with it but want to start this style, it is best to take a class, not use a video. (a video can be great for getting an idea of what to expect, but you will not get the correction and instruction that meets your individual needs from a video)2. Each series in Ashtanga(first, second, third, etc) is always the same sequence of poses. It is designed that one masters each pose and then moves on to the next, eventually completing the series. When one masters the first series (and this might take many years) one moves on to the second.3. Three months of yoga, no matter how many days a week you do it still makes you a beginner. One of my instructors has said you are a beginner until you have 10 years of consistent daily practice. Maybe that is a bit of an overstatement...but maybe not. Part of yoga is letting go of ego and being present where you are, wherever that is.So, yes, this is not a video for someone brand new to yoga.

I have only watched the first DVD because it is so loaded with good information and technique that It will keep me busy for months perfecting my form.  This is the most thorough and accurate yoga DVD I have ever seen.  If you just want to casually work your way through a relaxing DVD with soft music and a scenic background then this is not the DVD for you.  If you want to do the poses correctly so you can safely do inversions and still be rock solid I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  This is everything I wanted in a yoga DVD.  I have bought many and I am always left wanting.  Please remember my review is of the first of the two DVDs, but I imagine the second is just as good.  I am also coming back to yoga after many years of nothing so I guess you could call me an educated beginner????  I learned from books and DVDs so my form needs to be fine tuned and that is where Mathew's teaching style excels.Pro's1.  Everything is explained in crystal clear detail including angles of your feet and hands and how that affects the pose and your progress in the future.2.  Mathew's voice is pleasant to listen to.  I have one DVD that breaks my focus every time the instructor talks.3.  The teachings are methodical and in the perfect order to build strength before moving on to the next pose.4.  Inversions are taught in step by step increments building the balance and strength needed before doing the full inversion.  (I have only seen this done before with 1 or two increments.  His approach is much more thorough.)5.  I like the camera work and the plain background.  It doesn't distract you and the poses are very clear.6.  There is not a lot of fluff.  I am not a big fan of fluff.  If I want to know the history of yoga, I will study that on my own.  I do not want a 10 minute over generalized intro at the beginning of my DVD.7.  Based on my knowledge of yoga, his form seems to be perfect and his movements are so fluid it almost looks fake.  My niece actually thought we were pausing the video at one point.  That's what I aspire to be and some yoga DVD instructors look like they can barely do the pose themselves or the are using improper form which is both unsafe and limiting.Cons1. This isn't really the kind of DVD you can throw in and do as a workout.  There is the Sun Salute section which shows 5 different Sun Salutes from heavily modified to floating and jumping in and out.  I use that to go along with but it's really more of a demonstration.2.  It can be a little dry if you need a more inspirational feel.3.  His perfect form makes me feel like a wobbly fool, seeing as I am soooo out of condition right now.  I could see that as being a deterrent to the very beginner.  I just hold on to the memory I have from 15 years ago when I was the rock solid yoga junkie doing seemingly impossible poses despite my learning only from books and DVDs.  I will get there again.  Don't let that discourage you if you are a beginner.  It is better to learn proper form from the beginning than have to fix it later.4.  I hate when DVDs come in cardboard sleeves.  It guarantees they are going to get scratched before I remember to get a new case for them and then I have to cut the cardboard sleeve and try to find a way to keep it in the case I buy.  It's just an annoyance but it seems to happen a lot more these days.5.  He does this prayer thing at the beginning in another language with a caption in English.  I'm sure it's important to him.  I just find it annoying.I truly feel that the Cons are insignificant in compared to the amazing value in this DVD.  I only include them for the sake of veracity.I hope you find this review helpful.

It was apparent he was just getting rid of the tapes in an effort to only warehouse the way of the future, DVD's.I also want you to know he got big lifting weights and although bodyweight exercises are a great way to get in shape and even get strong, he is somewhat hypocritical in the way he puts down weight lifting.The third thing that aggravates me is the way some advocates of lifting heavy objects will also peddle their own version of goods in some of his daily emails.  They two have a bodyweight line and put down lifting weights in one set of books and advocate it in others.Still, this is a good book and I do recommend it.

Some reviews listed under this item are about different Pathfinder Protrek watches without the analog hands which I never seriously considered.  Analog dials have a great advantage - you can take a split-second glimpse and still know what time it is, and combined with digital dials they give you an abundance of available readings.  I have been looking for and buying only ana-digi watches like this because of their functionality and flexibility.The greatest selling point of this watch is the perfect combination of features that I am always looking for (listed in order of importance):- Analog-digital multi-function watch- Solar- Shock-resistant- Compass- Barometer- AltimeterSo far, I have been very proudly using this watch every day for two and a half years and it is still my #1 functionality-features watch in the world.  Although it's not listed as anti-shock but as \\\"Tough Solar\\\" it really is a very tough engineering work of art.  It still works perfectly even though it has gone through a significant number of abusing events.  Besides the annual vacation swims/dives in the sea and everyday normal movements, I'm an ex professional drummer who still frequently pats his knees in the rhythm of the music, and nowadays this watch has to withstand frequent clapping when listening to the music and playig with my daughter.  In addition, my 1.5 year old daughter used to play with it occasionally and she let it fall on the floor many times.  Moreover, this watch has two times received a hit that would have broken apart any other watch I have.  Once I accidentally hit a corner of a rock wall with it so hard that my hand hurt.  In spite of my expectations, all those abuses have only left a single barely visible scratch in the middle of the glass and several minor scratches on the bezel, so I can testify that the crystal/glass on it is very scratch resistant and the watch really is very tough.  I bought the titanium model/bracelet, so the entire watch is very light in spite of its size.The solar charging works great and the battery is almost always on H (high) position, and only in December during long nights and short days it sometimes goes to M (medium) and the contributing factor might be that I have the automatic backlight set up and it frequently lights up even when I don't need it.  When I get the M reading I can quickly charge the watch if I leave it in the window for half an hour during a sunny day because in the winter it is often covered with my sleeve when I'm outside.  Usually, instead of charging I like to push the envelope and see whether I can get it to L (low), but I've never seen that so far. At night and during prolonged low light conditions, the watch shuts off its digital displays to save power, but once you move the watch (or turn the backlight on), they turn on automatically and instantaneously.Some people complain about inaccurate temperature readings on watches like this, but you have to be aware that there is no way your watch will not get influenced by your body temperature, so you need to take it off and leave it for several minutes before you can get an accurate reading.  The only exception is when you are swimming/diving and you can obtain a reasonably accurate measurement of the water temperature in a matter of minutes without taking the watch off, especially if you are moving your arms and swimming or if water is otherwise flowing around the watch.The barometer/altimeter is accurate (of course, if you adjust it prior to your trip to a known reference point).  I always watch it on the airplane where you can tell which passenger plane keeps the air pressure best (or also which company is trying to save and scrape on air supplies and maintain low pressure)  - sometime you'll see the pressure drop about 33% before they adjust it and so the reading of the altimeter in a pressurized plane cabin is not at all accurate.  The internal artificial pressure they keep in the passenger cabin usually corresponds to 4000-6500 feet above the sea level.The compass function works well, but I think they should have allowed it to work for a longer and possibly adjustable period of time before shutting itself off automatically after 20 seconds.  I know it takes a considerable amount of battery power to run the compass but still, I'd like to have the option to run it for 30 seconds or a minute without having to press the button repeatedly.There is more I'd like to see and buy in a better watch and I have been looking for it for years, but I still haven't seen one as good as this.The only two main competitors I considered for a while were Tissot's T-Touch and Citizen's Eco-Drive Skyhawk.  The T-Touch watch, as seen in the James Bond movie is a bit less bulky and more dressy, so it looks better, but you have to spend about double the amount on it.  Still, if it were solar I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but since it's not, in my referent system that translates to a waste of time and money when the battery runs out and a questionable water resistance after replacement, so it's out of the question.  Citizen's similar solar bulky watch Eco-Drive Skyhawk is a bit more dressy, but its digital and analog dials are not independent and from some reviews I can also conclude that it's definitely not as tough and resistant as this one.  Omega had an amazing ana-digi multi-function Speedmaster X-33 watch that was a serious candidate for my favorite, however, that one was not solar powered, it was many times more expensive, and it is not being made any more, so Casio's PRG60T-7V still owns the \\\"THE WATCH\\\" title in my world.Some minor cons:- I'm 6'3\\\" and not skinny, and although together with the titanium bracelet it does have a rugged sturdy look, I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and definitely thinner.- Position of start/stop/reset buttons on the stop watch function is unusual.  The lower right button is used to start and stop and the upper right is used to reset (I'm used to the opposite).- The color of the first circular layer under the bezel (I suppose this is the solar charging part) is gray but in some light it gets an ugly-ish  purple shade- It takes a long time to circle almost 12 hours if your watch is one minute fast because I can only adjust the hands forward.  Fortunately, the watch is pretty accurate and I only do this several times a year, two  times because of the DST switch.Things I would like to see in a future improved model:- Atomic world-wide time adjustments- Count down timer.All in all, this is as good as it gets. I have been searching for a better watch for years, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This review is ...\"}, \"Great DVD.

This video is not for entertainment, but for engaging in a challenging and real yoga practice.  I personally am impressed that they have not including many distracting elements which are normally present (music, chattiness, etc.)  Richard focuses on the breathing and will often say \\\"this is mainly a breathing exercise\\\" pointing us to the fact that the breath is at the heart of the yoga practice.  He also focuses on holding the mula and uddiyanda bandhas.  One fault I see with this is that while he seems to expect us to be holding and using them throughout the practice, he only reminds us to do so a few times.  Not being well practiced in this myself, I could use more reminders.  Many of the poses are VERY difficult, and if you are well versed in yoga, you will also find many of them familiar.  The complete ashtanga practice is about 1 hr 50 min long.  For myself I purchased his Introduction to Ashtanga for a shorter option which is 76 min long.  Also, this \\\"introduction\\\" has a little more instruction, goes a little slower, and has a few more  variations on the poses for those who are just starting out.In the Primary Series, I am also very impressed with Richard's flow through chatarunga, upward dog, and downward dog, then jumping forward to sit between his hands.  This flow is common in ashtanga and other flow forms of yoga based on ashtanga, so that is not new.  But his immense control, and precise setting down of his body is amazing.  I intend not only to practice along with this video, but also to watch it carefully at other times, when I'm not doing yoga, just to study his form and flow.Another focus of his is gazing.  Very often he gives directions of where your eyes should be focused -- on the thumbs, the tip of the nose, the middle of the forehead, the big toe, etc.  I like this.  If he was as attentive to giving instructions on the bandas as he is to gazing, then i would be 110% happy.I have been practicing yoga for about 5 years, but this is the first time I've done formal ashtanga.  I have been doing Shiva Rea's CDs for about 2 years, and she is based in ashtanga, I now see.  But I have not found myself sweating profusely doing this yoga DVD.  While I find many of the poses challenging, and I do sweat, I wouldn't say that this is similar to \\\"power yoga\\\" that has become popular.  The poses aren't strung together all that fast.  I am usually breathing so hard that I can't keep my \\\"breath together\\\" as he advises, but I have only just started the video two days ago.

It's called Tamara Lackey's Capturing Life Through (Better) Photography.As the title suggests, this set is aimed at helping anyone who owns a camera learn how use it - well - better. Tamara speaks to non-professional audiences for the first time in this series, and the result is a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to use whatever equipment they've got to make the most of everyday snapshots.While many in the Photofocus audience already have a grasp on this material, it will be of keen interest to those who are constantly asked by friends and family about how to get better at photography.The 90-minute DVD is fast-paced, and offers incredible production quality. The product was filmed by Rex Ballard, Director of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. So if it looks like you're watching a professionally-produced television show instead of a cheap web-video it's because you are. This DVD contains straightforward tips from Tamara's professional experience, delivered in an energetic, engaging format - with some silliness thrown in as well. The DVD covers lots of ground, but it is a little light on the side of breaking down photography's more technical aspects. That's where the book comes in.The 100-page book dives right in to some of the toughest camera terminology and vocabulary, tackling the ISO/shutter speed/aperture relationship early on, but doing so in a fun and conversational manner. Tamara's take on how to best understand aperture and shutter speed is one of the freshest explanations I've heard.  It then moves on to breaking down the preset shooting modes seen commonly on most point-and-shoot and starter SLR cameras--what they do, and why they work.  The rest of the book is dedicated to applying Tamara's simple tips on five components of good photography--lighting, composition, background, interaction, and optional equipment and accessories--to scenarios like sports games, birthday parties, dinner with friends, or family portraits.  Filled with stunning imagery and a few really fun illustrations, it's a treat to flip through.The Quick Reference Guide is attractively designed and simple to use. This guide condenses the most important points covered in the DVD and book into a small camera bag-sized booklet. Including key point reminders, exposure charts and aperture diagrams, it reminds you of what you need to know in a style that's easy and encouraging.The three products do not depend on each other, but seem to work best as a set. There's also an accompanying iPhone app in the works.For new photographers - highly recommended.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Tamara Lackey has ...\"}, \"This is a good video in many ways, but I thought \\\"Primary Series\\\" meant more of the beginner mode (especially since he has an intermediate series)and many of the poses here are very advanced.

The down home, folksy style of writing makes it easy and accessible, like a good beginners book.  But some topics that beginners absolutely need to learn, like pot odds and implied odds, are skimmed over and barely touched on.  Other times, they'll simply repeat the same thing over and over again, with different ways of phrasing it.  I get that you need \\\"iron balls\\\" to play hold 'em; no need to word it 5 different ways in the span of two pages.The authors also like to make grand pronouncements and hold fast rules, as if they're reading from a stone tablet or something: \\\"Thou shalt not draw to a flush unless ye have the nut flush draw AND two overcards!\\\"  (This is not a direct quote from the book, but they do mention this \\\"concept\\\".)  Nevermind the absurdity of that statement; I just hate it when poker players say things as if they're the gospel truth.  There are going to be times where you should put money into the pot with a non-nut flush draw or even simply two overcards, let alone both of them.  The overall strategy described in this book is uber-tight, to say the least.  The authors are much more concerned with protecting their own chips then they are with taking them from others.  That's not a bad strategy for a beginner to start with, but if that's as far as your poker skills get, you're going to leave a lot of money on the table.This book is not without it's highlights.  The discussion on how to play small pocket pairs is refreshing, albeit only because two dissenting viewpoints are discussed.  T.J. doesn't really like them, while Tom will play any pair.  I mostly agree with Tom, especially if the stacks are deep.  The implied odds you get from hitting a set make pairs a very profitable hand to play, as long as you can get action when you hit it.  If you're at a table full of nits who don't pay off (players like T.J., for example) then you shouldn't waste your money with the small pairs, unless you're simply trying to steal the pot pre-flop (basically playing it like a semi-bluff).Overall, I was very disappointed with this book.  I think the main problem is it's target audience, or lack thereof.  It seems like the authors wrote this with serious poker players in mind, but it reads more like a beginners book.  If I had found this a few years back when I played ATC (any two cards) this would have been exactly what I needed.  Now that I know how to play the good kind of loose, this book does nothing for me.If you're a real tight player, you may find this book comforting.

If you are unfamiliar with kirtan, it is based on the concept of 'bhakti yoga' - the yoga of devotion. Singing the names of gods or goddesses in a call and response style with hypnotic Indian music in the background, kirtan is believed to bring a deep connection with the divinity within all of us.Jai Uttal's The Art and Practice of Ecstatic Chant delivers the whole mood of kirtan beautifully.  A devotee of kirtan since the age of 19, this talented musician has put together a CD that is melodic, sensuous, intense and truly uplifting.  You cannot help but feel moved when the first note hits your ears.  There is over 2 hours of music in this CD - and never once will you feel bored.  Uttal has a gorgeous voice - you can feel his love of kirtan in every syllable that he utters.There is an introduction in the CD, where Uttal explains kirtan and the path that led him to it.  This is a great piece - I feel that it gives an insight from a true devotee.  The intro helps even those who are new to kirtan to understand the significance and beauty of this ancient and spiritual art.  I recommend this highly to everyone - not just those on the yogic journey.There are a few kirtan 'stars' out there in the US these days - Krishna Das and Ragani to name a few - who are helping a wide audience enjoy and appreciate kirtan.

That is the player these books are written for.Many of the super tight approaches that Cloutier uses to be successful in tournament play are unprofitable in cash game play.

I have a very simple task; just select a point on a trail, then another point on the same trail, and use the trail as a route.  DeLorme let me do it, once.  Every other time I've tried, it just connects the two points with a straight line on the 2-D map and won't let me change it.  It does still allow me to delete the route, but that isn't much help.There are at least three different ways of creating a route using an existing trail, but all of them do the same thing; a straight line from endpoint to endpoint.  If I add points in between, it just connects them with straight line segments.  Theoretically, I suppose I could enter a large number of points in between and get something that resembles the actual trail length.Sometimes, as if to taunt me, it highlights the trail that I'm trying to get it to use as a route, but won't keep it as the route.  The tutorials and help pages all say that what I'm doing will use the trail as my route.  The software denies that claim.I've gone to the technical support website repeatedly, and the one concrete thing that I've learned is that I might as well watch television instead; it's just as useful and less irritating.  Technical support is a series of articles none of which have anything to do with the topic that I've searched.  If it has the phrase I've entered, it presents the article.  It even ignores anything that I've entered regarding which product I'm actually trying to get information on, and just lists every article, regardless of what product the article is referring to.

There was one 8 year old, and the oldest was 11. It is possible for children to do.As for the educational aspect, it is great for logical thinking and scientific experimentation. Once children start building their own creations, and yes it is possible, they start exploring the science of \\\"what if\\\", as in \\\"what if I move this piece higher\\\" or \\\"what if I change this angle\\\". Of course parents and educators sometimes need to supply the terminology and maybe an idea or two to move things along.Last on the educational theme, paired with other household or classroom objects this becomes a great way to introduce children to Rube Goldberg and making new inventions. Go ahead and Google him, I'll wait.My point with this review is you cannot to sit back and be a spectator with any educational toy. It does require some parent involvement.

I am a disabled female veteran so often this type of blind is better for me.  The \\\"named brands\\\" were ok.  The problem is that some just have an open window (which deer hate and I feel uncamoed and in full view) and another has 2 zippered flaps in front with the option of magnets holding up some netting should you want that.  That has been good, but usually problems occur if you are not on solid ground because the magnets won't hold the netting up.  So I would purchase magnets on my own to double up on the magnets in the blind, to help keep the netting in place.  However, with this No Name Chair blind this problem has been solved.  YOu have several options here.  You can unzip the solid front flap and have full netting.  The netting is CROSSWAYS rather than vertical.  Because of this you can slip your gun through the netting. This means your face and head are more covered.  If the shooting slit is up and down like the others your face and head movements can be seen.  Anyway, The other option is to close up the main flap and zip around  a smaller flap, still allowing you to slide your gun through the sideways slit.  Head and face pretty much camoed by the netting. Since I have a cervical spine injury I sometimes have to move my head and neck after sitting stationary.  This allows me to stretch my neck/head a bit without to much of a problem.  Only other difference from the more expensive named ones is there is only one drink holder on the chair inside (rather than 2) .. no big deal there and this does not have any \\\"pockets\\\" in side to put calls or stakes in.  BUT, there is a zippered pocket on the carry bag that holds stakes in that.  So all in all I am very pleased with this thing.  The stakes are a bit flimsy as are all of them for all brands and I will probably buy a more sturdy kind, but that does not detract from this blind.  The seat is roomy, does have a zippered opening at the bottom of the front, which is standard with all chair blinds I have found, so it is a pretty good comparison.  Again, I have to stress for me, the options on the front of this chair blind is what sells it for me and why I will purchase a second one.  Far more concealing (of my face and head) and gives me a more \\\"concealed feeling\\\".  Oh yes, it has to fairly largecovered and netted windows on the side. But I will use these only for viewing. I am not able to move a rifle to the side window without the blind moving but perhaps someone else could.  But those windows are great for air and for viewing game etc.  One last thing.  It does not have ties in places such as on the top and sides to allow you to tie a small branch to help with camouflage  Though I do actually like the camo enough not to worry about this.  Perhaps someone might take a star away because of this but I like the horizontal shooting netting so much I am not going to be concerned about minor flaws.  Shipping was fast and came very well packaged.Dec 17, 2012  Writing to give some updated information.  The blind broke at the back of the chair.  I contacted the seller.  They took immediate action.  I sent photos of the damages and they got a second blind out to me immediately.  The sent me a return UPS label so I could send the damaged one back.

He stated the following from scientificwrestling.com : \\\"Thanks for sending me that copy of the fat man Matt Furey's website. As you know I don't have a computer and I don't know how to use it, but as I can see he employs it for a con game to steal from some poor guys that love the sport.\\\".... And later in this same letter Gotch also states, \\\"The man is a disgrace to wrestling and has no honor at all, he can walk under a snake's belly wearing a top hat.\\\" Strong words indeed from a then 81 year old retired wrestling legend who Furey claimed was a teacher and mentor. Furthermore, Gotch says, \\\"I wrote you all this to show you that how can a fat slob like Furey, that doesn't know his elbow from his rear end, tell and show these poor boys that he charges an arm and a leg and a finger thrown in.\\\"The book (Combat Conditioning: Functional Exercises For Fitness And Combat Sports) is as  expensive as a Franklin Library leatherbound heirloom book.

Matt Furey has been accused of shameless self promoting at a level scarcely imagined by some of the industry's brightest lights. I have now sold my copy on ebay.There are, however, some positive qualities of Mr. Furey worth mentioning. He is a former NCAA Wrestling champ and he did train under Dan Gable at Iowa.

She explains and demonstrates why the old 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock, keeping your casting arm pinned to the body casting technique just isn't realistic. I'm a petite female and once Joan taught me it was ok to let my arm and rod go up and away from my body wow!, I had so much more power in my cast!  The best point she made for me and what I now realize is the heart of the cast, is the \\\"power snap\\\". Once you understand that part of the cast, the rest follows easily. The first few times I got the power snap right it was a major fishing epiphany for me.  It felt so good, I knew it was right!

It was quite a challenge though to get the 'lunitidal interval' value needed to display the correct tidal data. The manual lists the required numbers for several cities around the world, but tidal dynamics are extremely complicated and tides can differ several hours even when you go up north or south of the same coast. What made it more complicated, was that I am living in a country where English is not the main language, and I had no idea what I was looking for in local terms. Finally, I understood that lunitidal interval is known here as \\\"gemiddeld havengetal\\\" (Dutch), but still it was a real challenge to find it for the spot of coast I was planning to use the watch. It was not on the internet - ultimaltely I was able to find it in a specialized yearly nautical publication. I can imagine that not being able to find the right data, might let some users down. Casio should have realized this and should have put more effort into guiding the user to the right values. It might be the reason Casio left this option out of the newer Sea-Patchfinder models. For users in The Netherlands: I have uploaded a table at [...]As far as the watch: one problem I have with it, is that it does not have dual time, which I really need. Second, I do not understand why Casio has chosen not to print a complete 360 degree scale around the watch, but chose to print COMP, BARO and START in between the 210 and 330 degree values instead. Especially since it is also shown near the buttons as well as on the display at about the same spot. OK, it is nice to have a compass and a barometre, but don't need to read THREE times every time I look at my watch. Another disadvantage is that it is impossible to verify that the watch is level when using the compass. Especially at sea, this is essential. The watch does have some sort of tilt sensor to automatically switch on the light when you look at your wrist - it would have been nice if this feature had been used to indicate if the watch was level.A small disadvantage is the short lighting period. Having so many batteries aboard, this period could have been longer than 1.5 seconds. Also, it would have been nice if the moon graph was inverted - with the positive display showing the lighted part of the moon. Standing outside in the dark and pressing the light switch, results in seeing the dark part of the moon lighted up on your watch... Also, a button lock would have been nice. Because of its size, it is easy to press a button by mistake. Especially the Baro-button is prone to be pressed inadvertially when bending your wrist, supporting yourself during an activity.Otherwise, a perfect watch, which is extremely light for its size. The distinct beep when you return to time mode, is very handy. The glass does not scratch, it is perfectly protected by the bezel ring. I am looking for a replacement after 3 years, since the black plastic light switch broke off (it is only supported at the back by a small metal pin which is off-center, so pressing it eventually makes the connection snap) and the barometric pressure sensor went offline recently. Since I really need dual time and I do not like the newer Pathfinder model using about 1/4 of the display telling me about the battery status (what a waste of space!), I decided to compromise the tidal data and buy a Suunto watch (with button lock and sensor that indicates if the compass is level) next.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"I have the watch ...\"}, \"I have purchased several videos on Fly Casting and Fly Fishing, this one is absolutly the best.

      "ORIGINAL REVIEW:\n",
      "Twenty-five years ago when I was competing in junior golf tournaments all over the Midwest and struggling to improve I would have given anything for this book. I've worked in the golf publishing business for nearly 20 years and have never seen a step-by-step guide that explains how the best junior golfers continue to improve and reach their full potential until Journey to Excellence. It took someone of Henry Brunton's credentials to finally pull all the key information into one resource. Brunton is the Head Coach for the Canadian National Men's Team, he is the only Canadian ever named one of GOLF Magazine's Top 100 Teachers, he is the creator of the teaching curriculum used by the Canadian PGA and near Toronto he runs one of the finest regional junior programs in the world for competitive juniors. A program that has been emulated by instructors all over North America.Journey to Excellence details the intricacies of every major issue that a young competitive golfer will face while trying to become the best they can be. From equipment issues, to finding the right coach, to managing emotions to understanding how to earn a college scholarship, it's all right here in a breezy read filled with anecdotes from the game's best players who have already reached their full potential in the game.Brunton saw the need for providing honest, accurate information to the next generation of competitive golfers and spent two years working on this manuscript. It was a labor of love and it shows in the final work. I've been fortunate to know Henry for nearly 15 years and he is a major force who will lead junior golf in a positive direction for years to come. If you (or your child) enjoy competitive golf, this will be the best small investment you'll ever make on your golfing career.\n"

      "My kid just turned nine and was very excited to get this for xmas.  I helped him get started putting it together for a few hours one evening (we took our time, separated the parts and had to deal with two other brothers harassing us and/or trying to play with it) and we agreed to finish it the next day.  Next morning, I came downstairs at 10am and he had finished it himself.  He loves playing with it and his younger brother (6 yrs old) loves it so much he started playing with it as soon as we had put in the foundation!  Yes, as far as building this toy, it is definitely more complicated than most, but that is what they love about it.  And I really enjoyed spending time with my boy putting it together.  If your kids like to build things like legos, I guarantee he/she will really enjoy this.  If not, most will still like it for the marble fun and all the neat moving parts.  I think it also gets my kids thinking in ways they normally would not, especially with video games.  Next step I think I'll get them an erector set!\n",
